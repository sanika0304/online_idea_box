### ðŸ“– Project Description

**Online Idea Box** is a web-based platform designed to streamline idea collection, feedback, and communication between students, faculty, and administrators within an educational institution. The system provides a centralized space where users can submit innovative suggestions or raise concerns, and administrators can track, respond to, and manage those submissions efficiently.

The project features role-based access:

* **Students & Faculty** can register, log in, and submit ideas.
* **Admins** have a dedicated dashboard to view all submissions, update their status (like *Viewed*, *In Process*, or *Completed*), and send personalized replies.

It includes:
* A login/signup system with user roles.
* A clean and responsive user interface with dark transparent containers.
* Status tags with color badges for better visual feedback.
* PDF export functionality for saving idea records.
* Secure backend built with Flask and SQL Server for managing data.

This project encourages active participation and transparency in institutional development by making idea sharing accessible, organized, and trackable.
